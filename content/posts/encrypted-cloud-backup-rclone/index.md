Most of us have unused free cloud storage sitting idle. Google Drive offers 15GB. OneDrive gives you 5GB. Dropbox, another 2GB. Combined, that's over 20GB of free storage—enough for documents, configs, and critical files.

The problem? These providers hold the encryption keys. They can read your files. With rclone crypt, you can use their storage while keeping them blind to your data.

## The Zero-Trust Backup Strategy

The concept is simple: encrypt everything locally before it leaves your machine. The cloud provider only ever sees encrypted blobs. No keys. No metadata leakage. Just noise.

This gives you:
- **Free offsite backup** using storage you already have
- **End-to-end encryption** where only you hold the keys
- **Provider independence**—switch services without re-encrypting
- **Resilience** through geographic distribution

## What Is Rclone Crypt?

[Rclone](https://rclone.org/) is a command-line tool for managing files on cloud storage. Think of it as rsync for the cloud. It supports over 40 storage providers.

Rclone crypt is a virtual remote that wraps another remote with encryption. When you write files through it:
1. File names are encrypted (optional but recommended)
2. File contents are encrypted using XSalsa20 cipher
3. Files are authenticated using Poly1305

The encryption happens on your machine. The cloud provider never sees plaintext.

## Setting It Up

### Step 1: Install Rclone

```bash
# Linux
curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash

# Or via package manager
sudo apt install rclone    # Debian/Ubuntu
brew install rclone        # macOS
```

### Step 2: Configure a Cloud Remote

Run the interactive configuration:

```bash
rclone config
```

Select `n` for new remote, name it (e.g., `gdrive`), and follow the prompts for your provider. For Google Drive, you'll authenticate via browser.

### Step 3: Create the Crypt Remote

Run `rclone config` again:

```
n) New remote
name> gdrive-crypt
Storage> crypt
remote> gdrive:backup/encrypted
filename_encryption> standard
directory_name_encryption> true
Password> (enter a strong password)
Password2> (enter a salt password)
```

Key choices:
- **remote**: Points to a folder on your base remote (`gdrive:backup/encrypted`)
- **filename_encryption**: `standard` encrypts names, `off` leaves them readable
- **directory_name_encryption**: Encrypt folder names too

Store these passwords securely. Lose them, lose your data.

### Step 4: Sync Your Files

```bash
# Sync a local folder to encrypted cloud storage
rclone sync /home/user/documents gdrive-crypt:documents

# Check what's there
rclone ls gdrive-crypt:

# See the encrypted version (what Google sees)
rclone ls gdrive:backup/encrypted
```

The second command shows your files. The third shows the gibberish Google actually stores.

## Multi-Cloud Resilience

Why stop at one provider? Create crypt remotes for each free tier:

```bash
# Google Drive - 15GB
rclone sync ~/critical gdrive-crypt:critical

# OneDrive - 5GB
rclone sync ~/critical onedrive-crypt:critical

# Dropbox - 2GB
rclone sync ~/critical dropbox-crypt:critical
```

Now your critical files exist in three geographic locations, all encrypted with keys only you possess.

## Automating Backups

Create a backup script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# backup.sh

SOURCES="/home/user/documents /home/user/.config"
REMOTES="gdrive-crypt onedrive-crypt"

for remote in $REMOTES; do
    for source in $SOURCES; do
        folder=$(basename $source)
        rclone sync "$source" "$remote:$folder" --log-file=/var/log/rclone.log
    done
done
```

Schedule it with cron:

```bash
# Run daily at 2 AM
0 2 * * * /home/user/scripts/backup.sh
```

## What to Back Up

With limited free space, prioritize:

- **Documents** - Irreplaceable personal files
- **Configuration files** - `~/.config`, dotfiles, SSH keys (encrypted)
- **Password manager exports** - Encrypted database backups
- **Code projects** - Smaller repos without dependencies
- **Photos** - Curated important ones, not your entire library

Avoid:
- Large media files (use dedicated backup for these)
- Anything you can redownload
- System files (reinstall is faster than restore)

## Security Considerations

**Password strength matters.** Use long, random passwords generated by a password manager. The encryption is only as strong as your password.

**Store passwords separately.** Don't keep your rclone config password in the same place as your backups. Consider:
- Password manager entry
- Encrypted USB drive in a safe location
- Split between trusted family members

**Test restores regularly.** A backup you can't restore is worthless.

```bash
# Restore test
rclone copy gdrive-crypt:documents/test.txt /tmp/restore-test/
```

## Limitations

- **Sync conflicts** - Rclone doesn't handle bidirectional sync well. Use it for one-way backup, not active file sync.
- **API rate limits** - Heavy usage may hit provider limits
- **No versioning by default** - Consider `--backup-dir` for keeping old versions
- **Password loss is fatal** - No recovery without your encryption passwords

## Compared to Alternatives

| Solution | E2E Encrypted | Free Tier Friendly | CLI Native |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|------------|
| Rclone Crypt | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Cryptomator | Yes | Yes | No (GUI) |
| Native Cloud Encryption | No | Yes | Varies |
| Backblaze B2 | No* | Limited | Yes |

*Backblaze encrypts at rest, but holds keys

## Final Thoughts

Free cloud storage is a resource most people waste. With rclone crypt, you can transform these scattered gigabytes into a distributed, encrypted backup system.

The providers get nothing useful. You get peace of mind knowing your critical files survive even if your hardware doesn't.

Your data. Your keys. Their storage.

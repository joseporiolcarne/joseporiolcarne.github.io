## The Bullet Holes That Saved Thousands of Lives

It's 1943, and Allied bombers are getting shredded over Europe. Planes limp back to base riddled with bullet holes, and the top brass has a problem. Where do they add armor? The logical answer seems obvious—reinforce the areas with the most damage.

Every returning bomber told the same story through its wounds: bullet holes peppered the fuselage, wings, and tail sections. The data was overwhelming. The solution seemed clear.

Enter Abraham Wald, a Hungarian-Jewish mathematician working for the Statistical Research Group (SRG), a secret wartime think tank that included future Nobel laureates and mathematical legends. When military officials showed Wald their damage reports and proposed armoring the most-hit areas, he looked at the data and said something that seemed absurd:

**"Armor the places with *no* bullet holes."**

The room fell silent. Then Wald explained the invisible truth that would save thousands of lives—and teach us one of the most expensive lessons in thinking clearly about data.

## The Survivors Are Lying to You

Wald's insight was devastatingly simple: **The planes you're analyzing are the survivors.** They made it back despite taking damage to the fuselage, wings, and tail. The bullet holes you're counting aren't markers of vulnerability—they're proof of resilience.

The planes that took damage to the engines, cockpit, and other areas weren't in the hangar being studied. They were at the bottom of the English Channel or scattered across French countryside. Those aircraft couldn't tell their stories because they didn't survive.

This is **survivorship bias** in its purest form: the logical error of concentrating on the people or things that made it past some selection process while overlooking those that did not, typically because of their lack of visibility.

The military was about to spend millions reinforcing parts of the plane that didn't need it, while leaving the truly vulnerable areas exposed. Wald's insight reversed their strategy and fundamentally changed how we analyze incomplete data.

But here's the uncomfortable question: **How many times are you making the exact same mistake with your investments?**

## Why Your Portfolio Is Probably Built on a Lie

Let's fast-forward to today. You're researching investment strategies, and you stumble upon an article: *"The 10 Best-Performing Stocks of the Last Decade."* Amazon, Apple, Tesla, Netflix, NVIDIA—household names that turned early investors into millionaires. The article analyzes their common characteristics: visionary CEOs, disruptive technology, wearing a red cap...

You think: *"I'll invest in companies with these characteristics. It's foolproof!"*

Except it isn't. You've just walked into Abraham Wald's hangar, and you're only looking at the planes that made it back.

### The Mutual Fund Mirage

According to research examining mutual fund performance, **survivorship bias inflates reported returns by 1-2% annually.** That might not sound dramatic until you compound it over decades.

How does this happen? Simple. Poorly performing funds get quietly merged or liquidated. They disappear from databases. When you look up "20-year fund performance," you're only seeing the survivors—the funds that didn't fail. The failures, which often drastically underperformed before disappearing, are absent from the historical record.

Imagine studying "successful restaurants" by only visiting ones that are currently open. You'd never learn from the 60% that closed in their first three years. You'd develop a wildly optimistic view of the restaurant industry while completely missing the actual risk profile. Don't open a restaurant at least where I live.

This is precisely what happens when traders and investors rely on backtested strategies using survivorship-biased data.

## The Startup Success Story Nobody Tells

Silicon Valley worships its survivors. We dissect every decision made by Zuckerberg, Musk, and Bezos. We create pattern-matching formulas: *"Drop out of college, work 100-hour weeks, pivot when necessary, move fast, wear a red cup and break things."*

But here's the invisible graveyard: **Approximately 90% of startups fail.** For every Facebook, there are thousands of social networks that imploded. For every Tesla, there are hundreds of electric vehicle companies that burned through millions and evaporated.

Many failed founders also dropped out of college, worked insane hours, and pivoted constantly. The difference? They're not on magazine covers. They're working normal jobs, using train or bus, paying off debt, or trying again.

When developers decide to leave stable jobs to build the next big app, they're often basing that decision on survivor stories while being blind to the cemetery of failed projects that had equally passionate founders and seemingly solid ideas.

### The Survivorship Bias Formula for Developers

Let's make this concrete. You're a developer deciding between:

**Option A:** Join an early-stage startup with equity
**Option B:** Take a stable position at an established tech company

You research successful tech entrepreneurs. Most worked at startups early in their careers! The data seems clear—startups are the path to wealth.

But you're missing the data points of thousands of developers who joined startups that:
- Ran out of funding in 18 months
- Had toxic work cultures that burned them out
- Pivoted so many times the original equity became worthless
- Got acquired for pennies, wiping out common stockholders

This doesn't mean startups are bad choices. It means **your decision-making process is biased by incomplete data.** You're armoring the wrong parts of the plane.

## Trading Strategies: The Performance Illusion

For active traders, survivorship bias is particularly insidious because it infiltrates the very tools meant to help you succeed.

### The Backtest Trap

You discover a trading algorithm that backtested beautifully: 25% annual returns over 15 years! The strategy involves buying stocks that meet specific technical criteria.

Here's what you don't see: The backtest only includes companies still listed on major exchanges. The hundreds of companies that went bankrupt, got delisted, or became penny stocks during that period? Excluded from the analysis.

Your "25% annual return" might realistically be a 12% return—or even a loss—when accounting for the companies that failed. Some of your trades, based on your criteria, would have selected companies that later went to zero.

### The Index Fund Secret Weapon

This explains one of the most powerful advantages of index fund investing: **automatic immunity to survivorship bias.**

When you invest in an S&P 500 index fund, you're not just buying "the 500 best companies." You're buying a methodology that automatically removes failures and adds new successful companies. When a company craters and drops out of the index, you're no longer exposed to it. When a new high-performer enters, you automatically own it.

Active strategies trying to beat the market often suffer from survivorship bias in their analysis, while the index fund strategy mechanically accounts for it through its selection process.

## How to Armor the Right Parts of Your Financial Plane

So how do you make better decisions when the failures are invisible? Here are strategies grounded in the same statistical thinking that saved those WWII bombers:

### 1. **Seek Out the Graveyard Data**

Before investing based on success stories, actively search for failure data:

- **For stocks:** Research bankrupt companies in your target sector from the past decade
- **For strategies:** Look for critiques and failure analyses, not just success stories  
- **For startups:** Read postmortems from failed companies (sites like CBInsights publish these)

The uncomfortable truth is more valuable than the inspiring success story.

### 2. **The "Invisible Cemetery" Question**

Before making any major investment decision, ask: **"Who isn't in this dataset, and why?"**

- Looking at successful crypto traders on Twitter? Where are the broke ones? (They deleted their accounts)
- Reading about successful real estate flippers? How many lost money and aren't writing blogs about it?
- Studying billionaire habits? Millions of people wake up at 5 AM and journal—why aren't they billionaires?

### 3. **Diversification as Bias Insurance**

Perhaps the most practical defense: **Diversify across enough positions that individual survivor bias becomes statistically less damaging.**

If you concentrate your portfolio in 5-10 stocks selected from survivorship-biased analysis, you're taking massive uncompensated risk. If you own 500+ stocks via index funds, the bias becomes diluted across the entire market.

### 4. **Base Rate Thinking**

Before getting excited about any strategy, investment, or career move, ask about the base rate:

- **What percentage of people who try this approach succeed?**
- **Not "Can it work?" but "How often does it work?"**

If 90% of day traders lose money, your strategy needs to be genuinely exceptional to overcome those odds—not just "it backtested well."

## The Uncomfortable Truth About Success Patterns

Here's where survivorship bias gets philosophically thorny: Even when we account for it, we face a paradox.

Successful people often *do* share common traits: persistence, work ethic, risk tolerance, strategic thinking. But **unsuccessful people often share those exact same traits.** The difference might be luck, timing, network effects, or other factors impossible to isolate and replicate.

When you read that successful investors "trusted their gut" or "held through the panic," you're not told about the investors who did the same thing and lost everything. Both groups showed conviction. One happened to be right.

This doesn't mean success is purely random—it means **the patterns we extract from success stories are unreliable unless we also study the failures with equal rigor.**

### Build Anti-Fragile Positions (Taleb Dixit)

Instead of trying to identify the next Amazon (which requires near-perfect foresight and ignores the hundreds of similar-looking companies that failed), structure your portfolio to benefit from volatility and uncertainty:

- **Barbell strategy:** Extremely safe investments (treasury bonds, index funds) plus small, high-risk, asymmetric bets (early-stage startups, moonshot stocks) where losses are capped but potential gains are unlimited
- **Options strategies** that limit downside while maintaining upside exposure
- **Multiple small bets** rather than concentrated positions

## The Bottom Line: See What's Missing

Abraham Wald's genius wasn't in complex mathematics—it was in asking a simple question: **"What am I not seeing?"**

That question is worth millions to investors, traders, and developers. Maybe billions.

Every time you're about to make a decision based on success patterns, pause. Ask yourself:

- Who isn't in this story?
- What happened to the planes that didn't come back?
- Where are the traders who used this exact strategy and lost everything?
- Which startups followed this exact playbook and failed?

The invisible graveyard is massive. The survivors are rare. And the bullet holes you see are telling you about resilience, not vulnerability.

**The next time someone shows you data about what works, your first question should be: "Who's missing from this dataset?"**

That question—that single habit of thought—is the difference between armoring the wrong parts of your financial plane and actually protecting what matters.

Because in investing, as in aerial combat, the most important data is the data you *don't* see.

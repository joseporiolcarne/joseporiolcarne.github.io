I'm a developer and team lead, currently guiding Digital Transformation projects. I'm also an algorithmic trader, a field where I apply my core obsession: building autonomous systems that learn and improve.

**My core principles:** open-endedness, randomness, reinforcement learning, and survival of the fittest.

*Code that evolves, profit that grows.*

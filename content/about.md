I'm a developer and team lead, currently guiding Digital Transformations projects. I'm also an algorithmic trader, a field where I apply my core obsession: building autonomous systems that learn and improve. My core principles: open-endedness, randomness, RL and survival of the fittest.

Code that evolves, profit that grows.
